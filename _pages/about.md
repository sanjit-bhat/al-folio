I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student at [MIT PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/),
advised by [Frans Kaashoek](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kaashoek/) and [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/),
and supported by an [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) fellowship.
I enjoy hacking on big computer systems, especially when that results in increased security, reliability, and correctness.
Recently, I've been excited about the use of formal verification to guarantee such properties.

Prior to MIT, I was a [Turing Scholar](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars)
honors computer science undergraduate at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/),
advised by [Hovav Shacham](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~hovav/).
Before that, I spent three years in the [MIT PRIMES](http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php) program,
working with [Srini Devadas](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/)
and [Aleksander MÄ…dry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/).

Outside of academia, I interned at
Amazon's [automated reasoning research group](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning)
and at [Gradient](https://www.gradient.tech),
a deep tech cybersecurity and identity infrastructure startup.
